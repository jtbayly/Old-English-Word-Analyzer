# Old English Word Analyzer (A Mac OS service)

## Why did I create this?

I was about to start writing my first post on [SimpleWords.Work](https://www.SimpleWords.Work), and I got to wondering how often I'm using words from Old English. Lots of our common words are both simple and from Old English originally. I wanted a simple way to find out, so I started working on this. 

(I've written AppleScript before, but this time I used AI. I'm not sure it was any faster than I could have written it myself. It took a bunch of tries. I suspect AI would do better on a more common language.)

## How do you use it?

0. Install it on your Mac (see below)
1. Select some text, whereever you want.
2. Right-click and select Services->Old English Word Analyzer.
3. A popup will tell you the number of Old English words, the number of other words, and the percentage that were Old English.

It looks like this:

## Where did I get the list of English words from Old English?

I found it [on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Old_English_origin)

Let me know if you try it out, and what you think.
